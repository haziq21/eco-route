# EcoRoute: A greener way to travel

EcoRoute is a work-in-progress progressive web app meant to encourage car and taxi users in Singapore to switch to public transport.

## Features

As of now, EcoRoute is best viewed on mobile screens. On android, when visiting https://ecoroute.vercel.app/, an 'add to home screen' button should appear. Alternatively, click the three dot menu > install. On iOS Safari, click on share > add to home screen.
