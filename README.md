# EcoRoute: A greener way to travel

EcoRoute is a work-in-progress progressive web app meant to encourage car and taxi users in Singapore to switch to public transport. EcoRoute's main feature is route calculation using only public transport. EcoRoute also provides bus timings, bus / MRT service announcements, and location-based alarms (for use during travel).
